Here is some sample Python code that demonstrates how you might use the MultiWii software to control an autonomous drone:

Copy code
# Import the necessary libraries
from pyMultiwii import MultiWii
import time

# Connect to the MultiWii board
board = MultiWii("/dev/ttyUSB0")

# Set the roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle values
# These values can be adjusted to control the drone's movement
roll = 1500
pitch = 1500
yaw = 1500
throttle = 1000

while True:
  # Read the sensor data from the board
  data = board.getData(MultiWii.ATTITUDE)
  print(data)
  
  # Update the roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle values based on the sensor data
  # You can use an algorithm or PID controller to do this
  
  # Send the updated values to the motors
  board.sendCMD(8, MultiWii.SET_RAW_RC, [roll, pitch, yaw, throttle])
  
  # Sleep for a short time before the next iteration
  time.sleep(0.01)
This code connects to the MultiWii board, reads the sensor data, and uses it to update the roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle values. It then sends these values to the motors to control the drone's flight. You will need to customize this code to suit your specific drone and flight behavior. You will also need to handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the flight.
